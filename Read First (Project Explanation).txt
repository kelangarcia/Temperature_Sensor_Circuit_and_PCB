The Purpose of this project was to make a sensor that measures the temperature and then digitilize the result.
 
The PDF expalins the development of the circuit which measures temperature and transmits the result via
RS232. Temperature range should be from −10◦C to +50◦C. and it use a 5V ± 10% supply.

The circuit was simulated using LTspice and Matlab, Then the PCB design was made using KiCad.
